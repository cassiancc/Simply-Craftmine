25w14craftmine is one of the yearly April Fools updates for Minecraft, in which normal progression has been replaced by the new Mine Crafter block, which allows players to progress through custom dimensions (called Mines), slowly levelling up over time.

## Running a Mine

In a Mine, you must survive long enough to reach the exit. Time spent in the mine gathering resources can be used to level up your player through a new skill tree system. Over time, you'll also find new mine ingredients which can be used to customize the generated mines.
